# Giveaway
The giveaway command should be implemented with crons which should be set by the user through the command
`/giveaway n day`. 
Crons will be saved into the database and at application startup should be retrieved
and resumed. 
Eventually, all crons in the time of downtime of the bot should be delayed at the bot startup.
